* TODO Write a README
** TODO Learn [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]]
*** TODO Learn how github uses org-mode
That link above should point to http://orgmode.org, but github points it to orgmode.html

* C OCD fun
** byte arrays
Pascal-style strings, consisting of a length and a pointer.
The not-invented-here of malloc.
** consCell
combined with byte arrays (barrs) to make bconses
bcons a type with a value to make a typed cons (tc) cell
** iota evaluation
this will be used to implement some sort of a lisp

* TODO eventually, an interpreter
** TODO special forms for calls to other libraries
*** TODO network special forms
so I can program sockets with Lisp forms that manipulate streams
